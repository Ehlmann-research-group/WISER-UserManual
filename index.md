Welcome to WISER, the Workbench for Imaging Spectroscopy Exploration and
Research.  WISER makes it easy to load and analyze spectral imaging data sets
with a variety of helpful features.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:  WISER is currently in alpha, which means that this
documentation may be incomplete and/or out of date.**  Feel free to email
[wiser@caltech.edu](mailto:wiser@caltech.edu) if you have any questions or
comments.

# Overview

The goal of WISER is to provide an intuitive and configurable user interface
that supports many different workflows and styles of interaction.  When WISER
is started, the UI looks like this:

<img class="img_center" src="images/wiser_start.png" width="80%">

The WISER interface provides multiple panes for displaying raster data at
varying levels of magnification.  The Context Pane starts out on the left side
of the UI, and shows the raster data "scaled out," so that either one or both
dimensions are fully visible within the pane.  The primary viewing area is
called the Main Window, providing more detailed interactions with raster data,
possibly scaled up to as much as 1600%.  In the above screenshot, no raster
data is loaded yet, so these areas display "(no data)".

Across the top of the Main Window is the Main Toolbar, which provides various
tools to work with raster data:

<img class="img_center" src="images/main_toolbar.png" width="70%">

The buttons marked "Display Toggles" will show and hide specific tools for
interacting with spectral data.  These buttons are as follows:

<img class="img_center" src="images/display_toggles.png" width="40%">

These tools are described in subsequent sections.

**NOTE:**  WISER can also be extended with custom functionality through its
[plugin API](../API).

## WISER Configuration

WISER provides a configuration panel for specifying common configuration across
the various tools.  You can access these properties through the WISER menubar.
For example, on macOS you can access "WISER" -> "Preferences" to show this
dialog:

<img class="img_center" src="images/wiser_config.png" width="30%">

These settings are saved on disk so that they don't need to be specified every
time.  Some additional details are given in the following sections.

### WISER Crash and Error Reporting

WISER is capable of sending crash reports to an online service called
[BugSnag](https://www.bugsnag.com).  This option is **off** by default, but
it is very helpful if you turn this feature on so that application errors and
crashes can be identified and addressed automatically.  No personally
identifying information is sent to BugSnag, but some users may still not want
to leave such a feature on.

### Wavelengths for Red/Green/Blue Colors

For spectral data sets that include visible-light frequencies, WISER is able to
automatically choose "true-color" bands that are close to the frequencies of
red, green and blue light.  However, different data sets and instruments may
require tweaking of what is considered "red", "green" or "blue".  Thus, WISER
allows the user to configure these values.

# Viewing an Image

Here is a screenshot of WISER after loading AVIRIS data of the Caltech campus
and the surrounding Pasadena area.

<img class="img_center" src="images/wiser_caltech_annotated.png" width="80%">

In this image, all of the different tools have been shown using the display
toggle buttons in the main toolbar:  the context pane, the main window and the
zoom pane, as well as the spectral plot window and the dataset information
window.

All of these components are dockable, and can be moved or resized within the
WISER user interface.  They can also be undocked from the UI, so that they
appear as separate windows.  Arrange WISER's user interface however you like it
best!

As the snapshot indicates, the area visible in the zoom pane is indicated in the
main window.  Correspondingly, the area visible in the main window is indicated
in the context window.  _(Tip:  The color of this viewport highlight can be
changed in the WISER configuration dialog.)_  Mouse-clicks or scrolling within
the various display windows will update the other windows.

Mouse clicks within the main or zoom windows will also select the clicked-on
pixel, and update the spectrum plot window with the pixel's spectrum.

# Dataset Tools

The dataset toolbar buttons provide useful operations to switch between
datasets, change what bands are being displayed, and to adjust the contrast
stretch of the bands being displayed.  Note that all raster display windows
have one or more of these buttons, allowing for control of how raster data
is displayed.

<img class="img_center" src="images/main_display_buttons.png" width="30%">

## Dataset Chooser

The _dataset chooser_ simply allows the user to change what data set is being
displayed in a given pane.  When clicked, the dataset chooser will show a
pop-up menu listing all data sets currently loaded, and selecting a different
data set will switch the display to that data set.

## Band Chooser

The _band chooser_ shows a dialog that gives the user significant control over
what bands are being displayed, and whether the image is to be shown in RGB
mode (three bands) or grayscale mode (one band only).

<img class="img_center" src="images/band_chooser.png" width="40%">

Besides letting the user select any combination of bands, the band chooser also
exposes the ability to select the dataset's default bands, if any were
indicated in the original data file.  Finally, if the dataset specifies
wavelengths or frequencies for each band, and if these wavelengths are near the
red/green/blue frequencies specified in WISER's global configuration, the band
chooser can automatically choose the bands closest to these frequencies.

Note that if a data set does not have default display bands, or if the data
set doesn't have visible-light frequencies, the corresponding button in the
dialog will be disabled.

## Contrast Stretch

The contrast stretch tool provides sophisticated options for adjusting the
contrast of images being displayed.  This allows the user to bring out details
in the image data that might otherwise not be perceptible.

Here is an example of the contrast stretch tool being used with the Caltech
AVIRIS data.

<img class="img_center" src="images/stretch_full_linear.png" width="80%">

A histogram is shown for each display band, allowing one to see the
distribution of values for that band.  The user can select both the kind of
contrast stretch used, and any conditioners to apply to the data before
applying the stretch.  Because it is useful to see the results of applying
contrast stretch, changes in the dialog are immediately reflected in the
affected raster displays.  If the "Cancel" button is pressed, the changes
will be discarded; otherwise, they will be kept when the dialog is closed.

Here is another example of applying a 2.5% linear stretch to the Caltech
AVIRIS data:

<img class="img_center" src="images/stretch_2.5_linear.png" width="80%">

When applying a linear stretch, the sliders may be adjusted to control the
endpoints of the contrast-stretch operation.  Additionally, minimum and
maximum values may be specified, to exclude noise that appears outside the
range of useful data, or to focus in on a specific range of values.

For a detailed description of how WISER performs contrast stretch calculations,
please refer to [this document](./contrast-stretch.html).

# Regions of Interest

WISER supports the creation of Regions of Interest (ROI) on a raster data set.
Regions of Interest may be created in both the main window and the zoom window.
Once a ROI has been created, the average spectrum over the ROI may be plotted,
and the spectra of all pixels in the ROI may be exported as an ASCII file.

Here are the Region of Interest tools in the main toolbar:

<img class="img_center" src="images/roi_tools_annotated.png" width=400>

The first button allows a new Region of Interest to be created; a dialog allows
the user to enter basic details about the Region of Interest.  It is recommended
to use a different color for each Region of Interest to avoid confusion.

<img class="img_center" src="images/roi_create.png" width=400>

Once a Region of Interest is created, _selections_ may be added to the ROI.
The right button allows users to create rectangle, polygon, and point-set
selections, which will then be added to the current Region of Interest.  The
ROI that the selection is added to may be changed with the drop-down combobox
in the toolbar.

<img class="img_center" src="images/roi_add_selection.png" width=400>

> Tip:  The status bar at the bottom of the UI provides instructions about how
> to create each kind of selection.

Here is the UI state after two Regions of Interest have been created - one named
"grass" and the other named "solar panels".  Note that the "solar panels" ROI
is comprised of multiple overlapping rectangle selections (this could also be
done with a single polygon selection).  **It is not a problem to have
overlapping selections in a Region of Interest;** each pixel in the ROI will
only be used once by operations on the ROI.

<img class="img_center" src="images/roi_add_selection_3.png" width=400>

Once a Region of Interest has been created, right-clicking in the ROI's
selections will pop up a context menu providing various operations with the ROI.

*   The ROI's information or display color may be edited
*   Individual selections in the ROI may be edited or deleted, or the entire
    ROI may be deleted
*   The average spectrum of the ROI may be displayed in the spectrum plot
    window
*   The spectra of every pixel in the ROI may be exported as an ASCII file
