# Similarity Transform

The similarity transform tool allows you to do two things: rotate/scale an image and translate an image's coordinate system. 

## Translating Coordinate System

This section refers to the tool with the title 'Translate Coordinate Sys' in the Similarity Transform Dialog window.

The way we translate the coordinate system is by changing the upper-left coordinates of 
the geotransform. If you do not know what a geotransform is [here](https://gdal.org/en/stable/tutorials/geotransforms_tut.html) is a useful link explaining it. From this link, you will see that we change GT(0) and GT(3). This translates the geotransform for your coordinate system.

GT(0) corresponds to Lon/East and GT(3) corresponds to Lat/North. When the 'Translate Lat/North' and 'Translate Lon/East' fields are 0, the 'New Upper Left Pixel Lat/North' field will equal GT(3) and the 'New Upper Left Pixel Lon/East' field will equal GT(0). By entering values into the 'Translate Lat/North' and 'Translate Lon/East' editable fields, you will change the new upper left coordinate of your geo transform.

You can click on any pixel in the raster dataset and see the new spatial coordinate it will have. This information is under the raster image. Also you may have guessed that this feature only works with datasets that have geographic information.
